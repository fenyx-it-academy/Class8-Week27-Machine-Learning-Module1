### 1 - You will use the dataset linked at https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package. Since we are at the beginning of machine learning topics, we will not be concerned with NAN values. The variables we will use are as follows: ‘Location’, ‘MinTemp’, MaxTemp, Rainfall, WindGustDir, WindGustSpeed, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm, Pressure9am, Pressure3pm, Humidity9am, Humidity3am

#### You are expected to develop a model that predicts the maximum temperature by using these variables and by using the Multiple Linear, Lasso, Ridge and Polynomial regressions. Find the performance measurements for each model:
- R2
- Root Mean Squared Error
